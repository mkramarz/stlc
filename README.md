# Simply-Typed Lambda Calculus
An extremely quick-and-dirty collection of tools for the STLC, including:
- Parser (somewhat functional)
- Evaluator
- Unification variable solver
- Type inference algorithm

Everything is written in OCaml, with the Angstrom parser combinator library used for parsing.
